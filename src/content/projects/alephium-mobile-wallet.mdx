## Project Overview

The Alephium Desktop Wallet is a desktop application for the Alephium blockchain. It allows you to manage your Alephium assets and transactions.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenge was creating a desktop application that was fully accessible and compliant with the Alephium blockchain. We solved this by implementing a custom machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of voices and ambient conditions.
